			I'm very sure you have your own reasons to do so or not to do so, but lemme give you my own:

			<br>

			<div style="text-align: left;">
				<ul>
					<li>I'm a transgender content creator</li>
					<li>This allows me to create content without ads</li>
					<li>This also allows me to make all of my software open source</li>
					<li>This also also allows me to provide my games at a lower price</li>
					<li>This will help fund getting better equipment (higher quality content/ games)</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div style="text-align: center;">
				Overall its up to you, I don't expect you to support me at all, supporting me and my Patreon is completely optional, I wont guilt you into doing it.
